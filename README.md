#Just a header
This is a readme file.
Turns out that you can't have branches until you commit something.
I was trying to'git push origin main' and there was an error implyin that there's no branch called like that(i.e. main).It looked like it was 
saying that there was no branch called an empty space.
So git hadn't created a branch because I hadn't made any commits.
So the trick is to create sth and then commit it.
It also explains why the web version of a newly created repo doesn't show any branches until you create a file within that repo.
